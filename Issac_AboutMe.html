                                <p> Everyday our world is advacing with its technology. I also 
                                want to be able to be a part of that advancement using my skills.
                                Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Nathaniel Issac,
                                I am a student who currently studies at Dublin High School 
                                and I am currently building my way up to become either a 
                                cybersecurity engineer or a software engineer. As a 
                                child, I have never been shy about taking risks and doing 
                                different things. I have tried different activities from 
                                swimming for a year to play the piano for five years. To
                                also being able to be in different clubs such as Robotics. 
                                These different activities have influenced me to chase my
                                dreams of being a software engineer. I have always been
                                fascinated with technology. As I also use technology
                                through mobile phones, laptops to even cars. I have seen 
                                how it help people of all ages. From children being able 
                                to study faster and easier using laptops to having cars that
                                assist people. I love the way technology is being able to
                                help a lot of people. I plan to go to either UC Berkeley or
                                UCLA for my Bachelor degree for the job I want to do. I aim
                                to be able to be remembered as someone who has changed the
                                world of technology in the future ahead.<br><br>
                                Since seventh-grade I had developed the interest of programming.
                                As my  aunt is also a programmer she was able to show me 
                                a lot of about coding and I really enjoyed learning all 
                                about it from her. So in high school, I took Computer 
                                Science Principles which is a course based on programming
                                and it teaches all the basics of the major programming 
                                languages such as Python, Javascript, and HTML. I also in
                                the nearer future plan to take Principle Of Engineering 
                                which is an engineering course which teaches  about different
                                types of engineering and the basics of each. As well as 
                                also take Advanced Placement Computer Science which is a 
                                programming based class which goes in depth about each
                                programming language. I am a very passionate worker and 
                                a practical thinker in whatever work I do whether in groups
                                I have always learned to know when to lead and also when 
                                to follow. Through experience in different countries and 
                                schools and learned to be able to love and be passionate 
                                about whatever project or assignment you do. My dad through
                                the years has been able to teach the art of looking at 
                                everything with a practical mindset due to this I have 
                                been able to manage money and also help a lot of clubs 
                                with my managing skills.<br><br>
                                I have been fortunate to go and live in a couple of 
                                different countries and work with people of different 
                                cultures. Due to this, I have also been able to become
                                bilingual and because of that, I know languages such as
                                Malayalam, Hindi, Mandarin and also English. After getting
                                into the highschool I have been able to go to different 
                                organizations such as the  robotics club in my high school.
                                I am now on a team and I do building and I am learning
                                Vex C++ which is the programming language used for robots.
                                In general, this journey has really given me a lot of 
                                experience in different roles and jobs as well as it is 
                                also made it possible for me to learn new things. I hope
                                to learn even more in the future ahead.
