                                            :</strong> This project required to work 
                                            as a pair and make an image into something
                                            memorable for a client. This project was 
                                            from April 1, 2019 - April 25, 2019.<br><br><strong>Role in
                                            Project:</strong> My role in the project 
                                            was to start documentation as well as 
                                            also come up with a concept of what we
                                            should do for this project. I also started the 
                                            code for making the borders as well as 
                                            also made the user input.<br><br>
                                            <strong> What I learnt:</strong> 
                                            From this project I was able to understand how to 
                                            do multiple things in python such as user input
                                            as well as also time management skills. As this
                                            project had a limited amount of time I was able to
                                            to solve problems efficently.<br><br><strong>Challenges
                                            /Conclusion:</strong> For this project our
                                            major obstacles was making each color in the border
                                            have an even thickness. This was very hard because we 
                                            had used three different colors. But in the end after
                                            trial and error we were able to come up with a quick fix 
                                            and everything else was very good.</p>
